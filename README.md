Excersise Three: **Future Work**
The project was inspired by me trying to find research and emailed over 50 professor by sending emails individually. The process takes up a lot of time and could be done automatically. Knowing the corresponding research area of each professor could help the program modify the letter to better demostrate my stength to a specific academic field by emphasizing it in the letter. I can see this technique extending into all applications given the information of the target and individual.
